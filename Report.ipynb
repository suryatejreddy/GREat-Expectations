    "Every year approximately 10,000 students apply for graduate schools abroad (United States, Canada, United Kingdom etc.) from different Indian institutes. [These](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2016/03/21/number-of-indian-students-in-usa-statistics-analysis/) [articles](https://in.usembassy.gov/u-s-hosts-million-international-students-second-consecutive-year/) clearly indicate an exponential rise in the number of Indian students abroad enrolled in undergraduate, graduate and doctoral programs. With such a monumental student population, one would expect an interpretable and coherent system to analyse graduate student intake, measures correlations between the different factors related to admissions, corroborate to the noise and entropy in the admission process, and predict the chances of admission into a given university. However, we could not find such a holistic system that addressed these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore wanted to try and disentangle the process of graduate school admissions by analysing the various factors at stake, and apply our prior inductive biases about the randomness in the process to build predictive models. Our problem statement involves exploring and comprehending the following aspects of graduate school admissions:\n",
    "- Studying patterns in student profiles applying to different graduate schools across geographic locations.\n",
    "- Comparing, differentiating and gaining insights about the admission process.\n",
    "- Inferring and leveraging definitive existing correlations.\n",
    "- Drawing conclusions about admit/reject ratios, strength of an applicant profile, probability of admission, appropriate universities for a specific profile\n"

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "### Source \n",
    "We chose https://admits.fyi as a source to collect data from. The data (check below for description) is curated by a group of ex-grad students over the past few years. The data is checked manually to avoid any discrepancies. Key characteristics of the website are \n",
    "- The website has rate limting and cannot be scraped directly because of the dynamic nature of the website. \n",
    "- The website however allows us to set filters to search data that is relevant to us. \n",
    "- The results are paginated so all data cannot be collected at once\n",
    " \n",
    "### Collection\n",
    "To overcome all this we did the following for each university:\n",
    "- Open up the website and set a filter to get data only for that particular university.\n",
    "- Deploy Javascript that would click on the next page button\n",
    "    - Next set of results would be loaded from their server only upon this click.\n",
    "- We simulataneously start a network request capture mitmproxy that would allow us to snoop the requests made by the website on the server.\n",
    "- We couldn't replay the same request again because of authentication that was implemented. So instead we captured all the responses sent by the server by saving the entire capture. \n",
    "- Later we extracted the complete data of a university by analyzing the network capture and creating jsons. \n",
    "- The jsons would then allow us to process data later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of using this type of data collection was that we would even get fields not shown on the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "The website is made by ex-grad students from India. So it is robust and they tried to prevent automation to a large extent.\n",
    "- We couldn't scrape all data directly because of the dynamic content.\n",
    "- They implemented rate limiting from a given IP.\n",
    "- The requests in the network capture couldn't be replayed because of server-client authentication implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above solution we proposed is a semi automated method that overcomes all these challenges and gives us clean data to work with.\n",
