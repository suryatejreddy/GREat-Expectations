    "Every year approximately 10,000 students apply for graduate schools abroad (United States, Canada, United Kingdom etc.) from different Indian institutes. [These](https://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2016/03/21/number-of-indian-students-in-usa-statistics-analysis/) [articles](https://in.usembassy.gov/u-s-hosts-million-international-students-second-consecutive-year/) clearly indicate an exponential rise in the number of Indian students abroad enrolled in undergraduate, graduate and doctoral programs. With such a monumental student population, one would expect an interpretable and coherent system to analyse graduate student intake, measures correlations between the different factors related to admissions, corroborate to the noise and entropy in the admission process, and predict the chances of admission into a given university. However, we could not find such a holistic system that addressed these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore wanted to try and disentangle the process of graduate school admissions by analysing the various factors at stake, and apply our prior inductive biases about the randomness in the process to build predictive models. Our problem statement involves exploring and comprehending the following aspects of graduate school admissions:\n",
    "- Studying patterns in student profiles applying to different graduate schools across geographic locations.\n",
    "- Comparing, differentiating and gaining insights about the admission process.\n",
    "- Inferring and leveraging definitive existing correlations.\n",
    "- Drawing conclusions about admit/reject ratios, strength of an applicant profile, probability of admission, appropriate universities for a specific profile\n"
